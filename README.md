# Lacoca Personal-Finance-Analysis

![](personal_finance_image.jpg)


## Introduction

I developed an interactive Power BI dashboard tailored for Lacoca to streamline the tracking and monitoring of financial expenses. This tool not only saves time but also provides an easy-to-understand overview of the company's financial situation.


## Problem statement:

At a glance, this dashboard enables one to answer the following questions:

1.       What is the total income, total expenditure, and savings accumulated over a given period? 

2.       What is the categorical breakdown of expense and savings made in the past 3  years?

3.       how does the trend in actual savings compare to the  proposed monthly savings target?



## Skills/ concepts demonstrated:

## Analysis

Over three years, Lacoca generated a total income of $1.5 million, with 78.4% ($1.18 million) spent on expenses and 21.6% ($325,500) saved. Despite four significant income increases, total savings declined, and Lacoca met or exceeded the 25% savings target in only 12 out of 31 months. Expenses were primarily allocated to house rent (40.44%), groceries (24.2%), EMIs (21.4%), health (6.18%), and leisure (4.1%), with shopping accounting for the smallest portion at 3.68%. Savings were predominantly invested in mutual funds (71.58%), followed by emergency funds (14.44%) and fixed deposits (13.67%).




## Conclusion and Recommendations:

Based on these insights, these are the following takeaways:

1. Savings Strategy: Lacoca should allocate a larger portion of his finances to savings. Implementing an automatic savings system could be an effective way to achieve this goal.
2. Expense Management: Nearly 40.44% of Lacoca's expenses are going towards house rent. It would be beneficial to exlore options for reducing this significant cost, potentially by considering alternative housing arrangements.
